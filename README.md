=============

Libraries used:

A simple bar graph to show daily averages of a specific number. For example, this chart can be used to add up severity of a symptoms someone has experienced within the last week. Each symptom being measured with a numeric value, and then added up per day. So if someone experienced symptoms 3 times a day, and each symptom measured at a severity of 4 each time, this script would average out those 3 numbers and add it to an array with the associated date.
